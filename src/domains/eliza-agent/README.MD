# Eliza Agent Service

Service to manage Eliza agents in Docker containers, providing API endpoints to create, start, stop, and manage Eliza instances.

## Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop up and running
- Mac M1/M2/M3 users: In Docker Desktop Settings > Features in development:
  - Set "Virtual Machine Options" to "Docker VMM"

## Setup

1. Pull Eliza image:

```bash
docker pull julienbrs/eliza:latest
if on mac m1/m2/m3:
docker pull --platform linux/amd64 julienbrs/eliza:latest
```

2. Setup environment file in `docker/eliza/.env` with required configurations. If using Twitter client, include Twitter credentials:

```env
# Twitter Configuration
TWITTER_DRY_RUN=false
TWITTER_USERNAME=
TWITTER_PASSWORD=
TWITTER_EMAIL=
# ... other configurations
```

## Usage

The service expects a JSON payload in this format:

```json
{
    "name": "my-bot",
    "characterConfig": // JSON Config file
}
```

Example of a JSON to create an agent:

```

## Important Notes

- The `.env` file in `docker/eliza` is shared between all agents
- When using specific clients (e.g., Twitter), make sure to add corresponding credentials in the `.env` file
- Each agent runs in its own Docker container but shares the environment configuration

# To test a new eliza agent image

Build the agent's Docker image: ./scripts/docker.sh build in the agent's repository.
Wait 20 minutes since Docker is slow. In the end, a newly created image named eliza will appear in Docker Desktop.
Tag the image:
`docker tag image_id dockerhub_username/eliza:latest`
For example:
`docker tag sha256:2c3fdd2fc7520b89e95d043a3b3445ca8ce3155b1a2cc1eb4d21d8f7a3299f34 julienbrs/eliza:latest`

Then, go to the lftcrv-backend repository and do the following:

    Temporarily replace all occurrences of julienbrs/eliza:latest with dockerhub_username/eliza:latest.
    Run ./scripts/setup.sh.
    Execute pnpm run start:dev.
